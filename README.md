## About Me

- Hi there, I'm Michael K. Vermillion, but you can call me V15 (Vermillion15).
- I have a special affinity for the number 15 🎱 and the color red ❤️.
- Security enthusiast and avid coder, with a focus on Python and LuaU (for Roblox development).

- My goal is to approach security ethically and responsibly. Success is the goal and I plan on always hitting it.

## Music 🎵
